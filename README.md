## Overview
This application is a 3d Visualisation of Space. With models loaded to represent planets and realistic planet-looking textures to add to the space theme.
The Planet Models have been created in Blender by myself and I have used OpenGL to load these into a window.

## Inspiration
My inspiration behind this scene was space in general because it always looks nice despite the minamilist look to it, with solid black light and only a few small stars and such.
Essentiall simulating this in OpenGL was a success and the end result fulfilled my expectatons from my initial vision.

## Installation and Running the application
Open the .exe application file and run it. A CMD window should open before another Window opens with "Space!" as the title in the top left.

## Features
### 3D Model loading
3D Models created in Blender are loaded in this application

### Texture loading
Textures downloaded from [https://polyhaven.com/textures](url)


### Lighting
Lighting (light.vert/frag files) is used to make the models visible and not pitch black (as space is naturally black).
### Camera controls
WASD to move camera and left shift to move camera faster, space to pan up, left control to pan down.
### Shaders
Shaders (default.vert/frag files) is used.

My initials (GR) have been placed on one of the planets as my signature.

## Conclusion
Despite this being one of the hardest programming challenges I have faced to date, I think I have done very well in meeting the pitch expectations I set myself. 
Had I been given more time or had more experience and knowledge in OpenGL, I would have added a better variety of planets such as a ring around one planet to represent Saturn or a much larger planet emitting heavy light to act as the Sun.
